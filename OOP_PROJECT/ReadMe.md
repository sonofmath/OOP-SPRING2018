For this project I used a water level sensor with and arduino and a raspberry pi 3b to detect for a leak.  Using C++, I created different types of alerts that would be called accordingly based on the incoming data from the sensor.  These alerts all send me emails to update me on the situation. I would have it run every 15 minutes to check for a leak.
